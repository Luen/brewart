# AGENTS.md

Agent-focused guidance for this repository ([AGENTS.md format](https://agents.md/)). Human-facing docs live in `README.md`.

## Living document

Treat this file as **living documentation**. Update it in the same PR when the stack, scripts, branch model, deploy path, or other project facts change.

## Package manager

This repo uses **pnpm** (`packageManager` in `package.json`).

- Install: `pnpm install` (do not use npm/yarn for installs in this repo).
- Scripts: `pnpm run <script>` / `pnpm exec <bin>`.
- Lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml` only â€” do not commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
- Local disk: pnpm's content-addressable store shares package contents across checkouts on the same machine.
